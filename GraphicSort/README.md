This program creates GUI which shows how bubble sort's process runs with random numbers. Thanks to used semaphore, thread which is responsible for sorting can be stopped
in any moment by clicking 'Stop' button and resumed by clicking 'Run'. Speed of sorting can be changed with slider. Program obeys open-close principle so in order to add another type of sorting it's necessary only to create 
one additional class which extends 'Sorter' class. Another sorting algorythims will be added in the future.

Project was created with maven.

Source code can be found in \GraphicSort\src\main\java.

To test an application download GraphicSort-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar from target directory.
