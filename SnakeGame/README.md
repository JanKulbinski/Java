Program is a simple 'Snake' game.
The player controls a square (snake's head) on a bordered plane. As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake.
The snake has a specific length, so there is a moving tail a fixed number of units away from the head. 
The player loses when the snake runs into itself.
The goal is to eat as many items as possible by running into them with the head of the snake.
Each item eaten makes the snake longer, so controlling is progressively more difficult.
It is possible to go through the boards of the plane
